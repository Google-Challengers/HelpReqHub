## Introduction

Our app, `HelpReqHub`, is a digital platform dedicated to fostering a culture of empathy and assistance within communities. We believe in the power of collective support. Our app connects individuals seeking help with those eager to offer assistance, creating a network of compassion. With `HelpReqHub`, no request goes unheard. Whether it's a global call for aid or a community-specific need, our platform facilitates meaningful connections and tangible acts of kindness. From global outreach to local initiatives, `HelpReqHub` is your gateway to making a positive impact. Together, we're rewriting the narrative of community support and empowerment. In a world that often feels disconnected, `HelpReqHub` bridges the gap between those in need and those willing to lend a hand. Together, we're creating a web of support that knows no bounds.

**`Problem Statement`**

Basically we are creating a web application in which users can create up free account and go to the dashboard and ask
for request/help they want and choose role between receiver/requestor or supplier/helper and other(suppliers/helpers)
who are willingly want to help him/her can help, he/she can also create community/groups and members will join that community and within that community only they can ask for help and previous one was globally i.e every logged person can see the request.

- a community-driven platform that connects individuals in need with willing helpers
- aims to reduce social inequality and build sustainable communities, contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Reduced Inequality, and Sustainable Cities and Communities.
- It tackles issues of poverty, hunger, and limited access to resources by facilitating the redistribution of surplus food from events and hotels to those facing food-related hardships.
- Additionally, the platform empowers users to discreetly seek financial assistance within trusted
communities, addressing privacy concerns. AND MUCH MORE...

## SDG's [Goals]

- `SDG 1` - No Poverty
- `SDG 2` - Zero Hunger
- `SDG 17` - Partnerships for the Goals
- `SDG 11` - Sustainable Cities and Communities
- `SDG 8` - Decent Work and Economic Growth
- `SDG 3` - Good Health and Wellbeing

I majorly focused on partnership i.e people should have trust in one another and they should
help others in bad situation, I have seen this in my locality since childhood that my family
members used to deposit money to group of admins every month and those provide money on
low interest to other member in order to help and after every year end they give back the money
along with the interest what we should get, thought the interest is low but we help others
through this. Other goals are also linked through this only.
